##  Features
-  **Colorbot / Aim Assist** ‚Äì Tracks and aims at red dots using screen detection and FOV targeting.
-  **Triggerbot** ‚Äì Automatically fires when the crosshair overlaps a target.
-  **Smart GUI** ‚Äì PyQt5 GUI lets you adjust:
  - Aimbot speed
  - Detection color
  - Triggerbot toggle
  - FOV radius and offset
-  **Arduino Leonardo + USB Host Shield** ‚Äì Used for raw HID mouse input emulation.
-  **Stealth Mode** ‚Äì Hide the interface while the bot continues running.
-  **Spoofing Utility** ‚Äì Optional VID/PID spoofing tool to mask Arduino as a real HID device.
-  **Unspoof Option** ‚Äì Restores your original boards.txt settings easily.

##  How It Works
1. Run `spoofer.py` to change the Arduino's VID/PID (or unspoof).
2. Launch `launcher.py`, select your COM port.
3. Adjust aimbot parameters via the GUI.
4. Aim on/near dot color targets and let DotBot assist.

>**Note:** This feature list as-well as file being python is **subject to change** as development continues.
